<h1>Fun Relaxing Activitys!</h1>
<h2>Write a journal: Writing on paper can be highly cathartic. Buy yourself a journal and start writing. Write down what’s on your mind; write about things that have been bothering your lately; write about the things you love; write about past events that have been on your mind. Reflect on your writing.
<br>
  <br>
Write your worries down: Write your worries down on a piece of paper and burn the paper. Flash the ashes down the drain or watch them fly away in the wind.
<br>
  <br>
Walk up early: Walk up before the sun rises and smell the fresh air. Do some sun gazing and soak in the early morning sun rays.
  <br>
  <br>
Climb stairs: Climbing stairs is a great exercise and can also help in relieving stress.
<br>
  <br>
Go shopping: Go to an antique store or any other store that sells unique items and shop. You might end up finding something that could spark that dormant creativity in you.
<br>
  <br>
Day dream: Close your eyes and enter the dream world. Visualize being part of a beautiful world or having an amazing experience.
 <br>
  <br>
Listen to the birds: Go to a park and focus your attention on the birds chirping. Tune into their free energy.
<br>
  <br>
Clean your room: Clean or re-arrange your room. Give away things that you no longer require and create more space inside.
<br>
  <br>
Live without technology for a day: Switch off your mobile, walk away from your laptop and spend the day away from technology.
<br>
  <br>
 Write a Letter:It doesn’t have to be a greatly scripted tome, just a little note will be well appreciated.Taking the time to actually pen a letter shows you care more than sending an email or text.</h2>
