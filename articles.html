  <br>In 2009, septuagenarian Peter Bilello and his wife Grace did something even more adorable than old people dancing: They each signed a $1 bill, and kept those bills in their respective wallets as a constant reminder of their love for one another. One year later, tragedy struck: Peter, being a man, accidentally spent his Grace dollar while out shopping. True, the frozen burrito was probably delicious, but was it worth a symbol of undying love?Then genuine tragedy struck, when Grace succumbed to cancer. In 2015, Peter took his granddaughter to lunch at Subway. After sending her to the counter with 10 bucks to pay for their sandwiches, she returned with more than just questionable meats and a future case of intestinal discomfort -- she returned with $3 in change. When he counted it out (slowly and methodically, as is the way of all grandpas) Peter couldn't believe his eyes.Five years after he'd accidentally spent it, and Peter was reunited with the same dollar that bore his late wife's signature. He burst into tears and vowed right then and there never to part with it again, no matter how tempting a burrito he might be faced with.</h2><h6>Eric Yosomono - Ivan Farkas - Chris J. - Adam Koski - Markos Hasiotis - Daniel O'Brien - David Dietle<h6/>

   <h2>When Sion Cox received a phone call informing him that his lost dog had been found, he wasn't happy or relived -- he was just plain confused. A quick glance at his mom's living room revealed that both of their dogs were very much at home, and going about their important doggy business, which probably involved some combination of tongues and food.The caller informed Cox that the dog in question was named Chance, a Staffordshire Bull Terrier that had gone missing from Cox's home in Wales ... 10 years before.

But Chance randomly reappearing a full decade later isn't even the craziest part of this story: When Chance was found, he was down to just one day on his population control countdown. That's doggie death, if you didn't already decipher the doublespeak. When Cox went to snatch his decade-lost dog from the precipice of doom, Chance perked up as if he'd seen them just yesterday. Finally, a 'one day from retirement' story with a happy ending.

    <h2>A selfless London Marathon runner sacrificed his own race to help a physically exhausted competitor across the finish line.
Matthew Rees stopped his own race to help amateur runner David Wyeth, who collapsed 200 yards from the finish line.

Moments later a second man who appeared to work for the event stepped in to help David reach the end of the run.
